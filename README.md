🔍 Dataset Overview :

1. The dataset contains 550,068 Black Friday transactions with 10 variables, making it statistically reliable for population-level inference.

2. No missing values were found, indicating high data quality.

3. The primary metric of interest is Purchase Amount, while other variables capture customer demographics and product categories.



💰 Purchase Behavior & Distribution :

1. Purchase amounts are positively skewed, with a small number of high-value transactions driving the mean upward.

2. Mean purchase (₹9,264) is higher than the median (₹8,047), confirming the presence of premium or bulk purchases.

3. Spending varies widely (₹12 to ₹23,961), highlighting diverse customer purchasing power during Black Friday.

4. The median purchase value better represents a typical customer than the mean.



👥 Customer Demographics Insights :

1. Male customers account for ~75% of transactions, indicating higher participation rather than significantly higher spending power.

2. The 26–35 age group dominates transaction volume, followed by 36–45 and 18–25, making working-age adults (18–45) the core customer segment.

3. Customers aged 0–17 and 55+ contribute relatively fewer transactions, suggesting limited campaign relevance for these segments.

4. City Category B shows the highest transaction volume, indicating strong performance in mid-tier cities.

5. Unmarried customers transact more frequently, though frequency does not imply higher per-transaction spending.



🛒 Product Category Insights :

1. A small number of product categories (notably Category 5, 1, and 8) drive the majority of sales.

2. Several product categories show minimal demand, indicating opportunities for:

Inventory optimization

Targeted promotions

Category rationalization during peak sales events



⚖️ Gender-Based Spending Analysis :

1. Average purchase per transaction:

Male customers: ₹9,437

Female customers: ₹8,735

2. Although males spend ~₹703 more per transaction on average, confidence interval analysis shows significant overlap.

3. This overlap indicates that the difference is not statistically significant at the population level.

4. Conclusion: Gender alone should not be used for differentiated pricing or targeting strategies.



💍 Marital Status Analysis :

1. Married customers show slightly higher spending variability, likely due to household or bulk purchases.

2. However, confidence intervals for married and unmarried customers overlap almost completely.

3. Conclusion: Marital status is not a meaningful differentiator of spending behavior during Black Friday.



🎂 Age-Based Spending Patterns :

1. Average spending increases with age, peaking in the 51–55 age group.

2. Younger customers spend less per transaction, while middle-aged customers exhibit higher and more stable spending behavior.

3. Age influences spending levels, but differences are gradual rather than extreme.



📐 Statistical & Business Takeaways :

1. Despite skewed raw data, the Central Limit Theorem (CLT) allows reliable inference using large samples.

2. Confidence intervals (90%, 95%, 99%) demonstrate the trade-off between certainty and precision:

90% CI → suitable for pilots and A/B tests

95% CI → ideal for marketing decisions

99% CI → reserved for high-risk pricing decisions

3. Increasing sample size improves estimate precision by reducing standard error.



🚀 Final Business Conclusion :

1. Customer participation, rather than demographic-based spending differences, primarily drives Black Friday revenue.

2. Spending behavior across gender and marital status is statistically similar, reinforcing the need for inclusive campaign strategies.

3. Product focus and city-level targeting offer greater revenue impact than demographic segmentation alone.

4. Walmart’s Black Friday success is driven by a few dominant customer segments and product categories, not uniform demand.
