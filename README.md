🔍 Dataset Overview

The dataset contains 550,068 Black Friday transactions with 10 variables, making it statistically reliable for population-level inference.
No missing values were found, indicating high data quality.
The primary metric of interest is Purchase Amount, while other variables capture customer demographics and product categories.

💰 Purchase Behavior & Distribution
Purchase amounts are positively skewed, with a small number of high-value transactions driving the mean upward.
Mean purchase (₹9,264) is higher than the median (₹8,047), confirming the presence of premium or bulk purchases.
Spending varies widely (₹12 to ₹23,961), highlighting diverse customer purchasing power during Black Friday.
The median purchase value better represents a typical customer than the mean.

👥 Customer Demographics Insights
Male customers account for ~75% of transactions, indicating higher participation rather than significantly higher spending power.
The 26–35 age group dominates transaction volume, followed by 36–45 and 18–25, making working-age adults (18–45) the core customer segment.
Customers aged 0–17 and 55+ contribute relatively fewer transactions, suggesting limited campaign relevance for these segments.
City Category B shows the highest transaction volume, indicating strong performance in mid-tier cities.
Unmarried customers transact more frequently, though frequency does not imply higher per-transaction spending.

🛒 Product Category Insights
A small number of product categories (notably Category 5, 1, and 8) drive the majority of sales.
Several product categories show minimal demand, indicating opportunities for:
1. Inventory optimization
2. Targeted promotions
3. Category rationalization during peak sales events

⚖️ Gender-Based Spending Analysis
Average purchase per transaction:
Male customers: ₹9,437
Female customers: ₹8,735
Although males spend ~₹703 more per transaction on average, confidence interval analysis shows significant overlap.
This overlap indicates that the difference is not statistically significant at the population level.
Conclusion: Gender alone should not be used for differentiated pricing or targeting strategies.

💍 Marital Status Analysis
Married customers show slightly higher spending variability, likely due to household or bulk purchases.
However, confidence intervals for married and unmarried customers overlap almost completely.
Conclusion: Marital status is not a meaningful differentiator of spending behavior during Black Friday.

🎂 Age-Based Spending Patterns
Average spending increases with age, peaking in the 51–55 age group.
Younger customers spend less per transaction, while middle-aged customers exhibit higher and more stable spending behavior.
Age influences spending levels, but differences are gradual rather than extreme.

📐 Statistical & Business Takeaways
Despite skewed raw data, the Central Limit Theorem (CLT) allows reliable inference using large samples.
Confidence intervals (90%, 95%, 99%) demonstrate the trade-off between certainty and precision:
90% CI → suitable for pilots and A/B tests
95% CI → ideal for marketing decisions
99% CI → reserved for high-risk pricing decisions
Increasing sample size improves estimate precision by reducing standard error.

🚀 Final Business Conclusion
Customer participation, rather than demographic-based spending differences, primarily drives Black Friday revenue.
Spending behavior across gender and marital status is statistically similar, reinforcing the need for inclusive campaign strategies.
Product focus and city-level targeting offer greater revenue impact than demographic segmentation alone.
Walmart’s Black Friday success is driven by a few dominant customer segments and product categories, not uniform demand.
